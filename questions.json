    "question": "Will I have a chance at succeeding?",
    "answer": "If you are motivated and enthusiastic about learning technology, then yes, you will. You don't need a special cape or a magic wand to be a programmer. You don't need advanced math or calculus. Programming is a language and a way of thinking. Anybody who wants to learn to program proficiently can do so.

    "question": "What Languages do you teach? What will I learn?",
    "answer": "We give you exposure to the full stack. You’ll learn Javascript, Ruby, HTML/CSS, and SQL. But learning the languages isn’t really that helpful unless you also know the frameworks in which to apply them. You’ll get experience applying the programming languages you learn in frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Capybara, JQuery, and PostgreSQL"
